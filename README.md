Hello, this is web.dev.dzx.

I've created this simple data storage system (data is saved in your computer's local storage, as there is no database).

This system is designed for people who tend to forget their passwords. You can enter your name, email address, password, and data category (email accounts, game accounts, social media, development accounts, etc.), then click "Save". The data will be stored in your computer's local storage.

The system includes convenient buttons to:
- Show/hide passwords
- Copy all information without manual selection

All data is password-protected. You must enter the correct password to add or view any information.

The default password is: admin123
